# 6. distributed

Date: 2024-10-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In the future, there might be a need of an application that handles distribution/virtualization natively.

## Decision

For this case, we decided to use an `Erlang-based` programming language. This will either be [Gleam](https://gleam.run/)
or [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

## Consequences

As we currently have no use-case that needs such an application, the decision may change over time.
