# 2. Pick underlying infrastructure provider

Date: 2024-09-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide whether or not we'd like to build our underlying application infrastructure on a fully managed Cloud services approach (e.g. AWS) or on Kubernetes.

## Decision

We've decided to go forward with building our application stack on Kubernetes. Further discussions as to where Kubernetes will be hosted needed.

## Consequences

Our application landscape will be exclusively run on Kubernetes cluster(s).
